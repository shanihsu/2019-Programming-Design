#Question A
1. Use vector to store data readed from file.in.
2. Use sort function and reverse function to choose the top 5 data.
3. Calculate five data and cout.

#Question B

##The results


size:100

sort(): 4.8e-05 seconds

v1/v2 are different.

insertion_sort(): 0.00016 seconds

v1/v2 are the same.


size:1000

sort(): 0.000458 seconds

v1/v2 are different.

insertion_sort(): 0.016219 seconds

v1/v2 are the same.


size:10000

sort(): 0.005147 seconds

v1/v2 are different.

insertion_sort(): 1.60441 seconds

v1/v2 are the same.


size:100000

sort(): 0.063664 seconds

v1/v2 are different.

insertion_sort(): 160.126 seconds

v1/v2 are the same.


size:1000000

sort(): 0.748258 seconds

v1/v2 are different.

insertion_sort(): 13726.8 seconds

v1/v2 are the same.

##The difference between O(n log n) and O(n^2):

The time using sort() is much less than using insertion_sort(). 

The time using sort() is O(n log n), and the time using insertion_sort() is O(n^2).

From the result, we conclude that if the process of execution is simple, and then the time it cost will be long.

And if the process of execution is complex, and then the time it cost will be short.
